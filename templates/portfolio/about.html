                <h2>My <span class="gradient-text">love of</span> coding</h2>
            </div>
            
            <p class="journey-paragraph">
                My coding journey started with an unexpected spark during my biology degree. 
                When I first opened RStudio and watched statistical graphs materialise from 
                simple lines of code, something clicked. The ability to create something 
                tangible from pure logic was intoxicating.
            </p>
            
            <p class="journey-paragraph">
                I first started small with Codecademy courses and learning from free MIT lectures online. Building small projects 
                and trying out new skills. But my first real challenge, was Holiday Cluedo. It sounds silly, but building a web app where friends and family could play real life cluedo taught me more than any tutorial ever could.
            </p>
            
            <p class="journey-paragraph">
                That learning process and building projects made pursuing a Master's in Computer Science an easy decision. Throughout my academic years, I didn't just fall in love with software engineering I became fascinated by the fundamentals of computing as well. From the binary operations on silicon chips that allow my CPU to execute programs, through the layered internet protocols connecting devices worldwide, all the way up to the neural networks designed to enable intelligent artificial learning. Since then, I was officially hooked.
            </p>

            <p class="journey-paragraph">
                After a year of intensive study and personal projects, I've discovered 
                so many facets of software engineering that i've grown a passion for : machine learning engineering, the elegant 
                logic behind neural networks, wrangling massive datasets, video game design, and full-stack engineering and developement. I'm still early in my journey, but I'm learning something new every day and constantly looking for challenges that push my limits.
            </p>

            <p class="journey-paragraph">
                I've come to realise that no task is too great or too small when you have 
                genuine passion driving you forward. Whether I'm building AI systems for 
                clients, full-stack solutions for an employer, or experimental projects in 
                my spare time, the excitement remains the same, and i've come to realise that no task is too daunting or of little importance when you have genuine passion driving you forward.
            </p>

            <p class="journey-paragraph">
                This is just the beginning of my coding journey, but with every line of code I 
                write, I feel more connected to the endless possibilities at my fingertips.
